The chapters you should read depend on your level of familiarity with algorithms and data structures, as well as your goals for leetcode. However, some general recommendations are:

-   If you are a beginner or want to review the basics, you should read Part I (Foundations), Part II (Sorting and Order Statistics), Part III (Data Structures) and Part VI (Graph Algorithms). These parts cover the most common and fundamental topics that appear in leetcode problems, such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, etc.
-   If you are intermediate or want to learn some advanced techniques, you should read Part IV (Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques) and Part VII (Selected Topics in Algorithms and Data Structures). These parts cover some more challenging and specialized topics that can help you solve harder leetcode problems, such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, multithreading, matrix operations, linear programming, FFT, number theory, string matching, computational geometry, NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, etc.
-   If you are advanced or want to deepen your understanding of the theory and mathematics behind algorithms and data structures, you should read Part V (Advanced Data Structures) and Part VIII (Appendices). These parts cover some more complex and sophisticated data structures that can improve the performance of some algorithms, such as B-trees, Fibonacci heaps, van Emde Boas trees, disjoint sets, etc. They also cover some mathematical tools that can help you analyze the correctness and efficiency of algorithms and data structures, such as summations, sets, counting, probability, matrices, etc.

I hope this helps you plan your study. Good luck with leetcode! ðŸ˜Š
